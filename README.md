# reconnect

A new Flutter application.

## What is this application
Reconnecting with your old friends is something that is always in mind of all graduated people but
due to absence of an intelligent platform they are only left to wander on various social networking
sites to search to search individually for each person they remember. Our team decided to come up
with and effective and feasible solution to this problem for this year’s dbms mini project.

## How app works
It’s an android application which will run on most of the android devices, on opening the app the
user will be asked to enter either sign up or log in. For sign up user will be asked to fill his
school/college name and the year of graduation, after the login/sign up is done user will be
automatically to a specific chat room consisting of people form that specific school/college and year
of graduation.
