# reconnect


## What is this application
Reconnecting with your old friends is something that is always in mind of all graduates but
due to absence of an intelligent platform they are only left to wander on various social networking
sites to search individually for each person they remember. Wont it be nice if you could fill out your school/college details in an application and you will be automatically connnected to all your high-shool and college mates.
This app serves exactly that purpose.

## How app works
Itâ€™s an android application which will run on most of the android devices, on opening the app the
user will be asked to enter either sign up or log in. For sign up user will be asked to fill his
school/college name and the year of graduation, after the login/sign up is done user will be
automatically to a specific chat room consisting of people form that specific school/college and year
of graduation.
